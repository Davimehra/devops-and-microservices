Kubernetes Notes
Kubernetes works with all container runtimes that implement a standard known as the 
Container Runtime Interface (CRI).
This is essentially a standard way of communicating between Kubernetes and the container runtime, any any runtime that supports this standard automatically works with Kubernetes.

so kubelet -> CRI -> Runtime Container (like Docker) 
Kubelet will talk to the CRI and CRI will talk further to the Runtime Container


Note why Kubernetes deprecated Docker in Latest release ?

Docker does not implement the CRI, so Kubernetes implemented the Dockershim,
an additional layer to seve as an interface between Kubernetes and Docker. 
Now however, there are plenty of runtimes available that implement the CRI, and it no longer make sense for Kubernetes to maintain special support for Docker.
 
Docker with Kubernetes

Docker have dockerVolumes, dockerNetwork, dockerD as container runtime
So Kubernetes need to interact with only dockerD component of Docker


Containerd vs dockerd ?
