StatefulSets vs StatelessSets

Stateless are the servers
it does't require any data to be stored in it

Statefull are the databases
it required an persistent data to be stored in it


Statefull benifits

1. Seperate PVs will be assign for each replicated pod (to maintain data consistancy)
2. Ordered Pods , the replicated pods will be initialted in ordered format
3. Sticky Identity, the name of the pods will be very familary like (mongo-0, mongo-1,mongo-2 ...etc)
4. Stable DNS , if we create HeadLess-Service (by manipulating - clusterIP: None)




MongoDB StatefulSets with ReplicaSets

1. This mechanism will assign concept of Master and Slaves
 	Master can be any one replicatedPod           (basically - mongo-0)
 	Slaves can be as many replicatedPod you want  (like - mongo-1,mongo-2 ....etc)

ImportantNote
    If you want to deploy replicas in standalone environment check this video index 2
   (using 3 replicas - using cmd like - rs.status(), rs.initiate(), rs.addmember())
  
2. To access that specific MasterPod of replicaSets we need an headless service
   ** TO make service an Headless-Service = set clusterIP: None
      Example
      
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: mongo-svc
      spec:
        selector:
          app: mongo-app
        type: ClusterIP
        clusterIP: None
        ports:
          protocol: TCP
          port: 27017
          targetPort: 27017 
          
     Usage & Explanation
     
     Now in our Kubernetes DNS we can directly go to specific POD without LoadBalancing if we defined service as Headless
     this will make an entry for eachPod address in DNS
     
   Eg-       mongo-0.mongo.default.svc.cluster.local:27017
     
  syntax -   PodName.ServiceName.NameSpaceName.svc.cluster.local:AccessPort_Container
		
* In kubernetes via docker images you can simply use ENV variables to make any pod Primary or Secondary





Difference between LoadBalancing and Headless Service ?
LoadBalancer will send the request to any random server of same type described in targetGroups
Headless Service will send request to specific target registed in DNS
