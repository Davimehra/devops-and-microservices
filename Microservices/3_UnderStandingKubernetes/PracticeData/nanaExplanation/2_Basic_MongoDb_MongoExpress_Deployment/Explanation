In this Example we will be creating
0. create configMap and secret component located outside the pod            
   (for collecting centralized data like database_Url,mongo_userName,mongo_password ,etc) (helps to use this data in future)
1. mongo deployment 
2. internal Service for mongodb deployment          (using ClusterIP for MongoExpress to communicate)
3. mongo-express deployment
4. extenal Service for mongo-express                (using loadbalancer service type) (will need to create two open ports for {internalServiceIP,externalServiceIP})
