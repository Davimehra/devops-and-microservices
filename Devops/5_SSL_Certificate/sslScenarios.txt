If the web deployment service provider has already installed an SSL certificate, you may not need to install another SSL certificate on your Node.js server. However, it depends on the specific setup and configuration. Here are a few possible scenarios:

1. Proxy setup: If the service provider has installed the SSL certificate on a reverse proxy or load balancer, and your Node.js server is behind that proxy, then you might not need to install an SSL certificate on your Node.js server. The proxy will handle the SSL termination, and your server can communicate with the proxy using plain HTTP.
2. Passthrough setup: If the service provider has installed the SSL certificate on a passthrough setup (e.g., a CDN or a cloud provider's SSL termination service), then you will need to install an SSL certificate on your Node.js server. This is because the request is passed through to your server, and your server needs to handle the SSL connection.
3. Custom setup: If you have a custom setup where the SSL certificate is installed on a separate server or device, you might need to install an SSL certificate on your Node.js server or configure your server to use the existing certificate.

To create an HTTPS server in Node.js, you will need to provide the SSL certificate and private key files to the https.createServer() method. If you don't have these files, you can generate a self-signed certificate or obtain a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

In summary, it's essential to understand your specific deployment setup and configuration to determine if you need to install an SSL certificate on your Node.js server. If you're unsure, you can consult with your service provider or check their documentation for guidance
